The strong form of for the 1D heat conduction problem is given as follows, where $T$ is temperature, $k$ is thermal conductivity, $A$ is cross-sectional area, $s$ is the heat source, $q$ is heat flux. The domain is denoted as $\Omega$. The boundaries ares denoted as $\Gamma_T$ where the temperature is prescribed, $\Gamma_q$ where the flux is prescribed, and $\Gamma_h$ on the flux is known in terms of the convective heat transfer coefficient ($h$) and ambient temperature ($T_{\infty}$).

\begin{equation}\begin{split}\label{eq:strong}
& \df{}{x}\bigg({Ak \df{T}{x}}\bigg) + s = 0 \quad \text{on} \quad \Omega, \\
& \vec{q}\cdot \hat{n} = \bar{q} \quad \text{on} \quad \Gamma_q, \\
& \vec{q}\cdot \hat{n} = h(T - T_{\infty}) \quad \text{on} \quad \Gamma_h, \\
& T = \bar{T} \quad \text{on} \quad \Gamma_T.
\end{split}\end{equation}

Derive the weak form of Equation \eqref{eq:strong}, the finite element stiffness matrix, and the finite element force vector.
