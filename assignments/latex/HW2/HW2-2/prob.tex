Modify the tutorial program to solve the above problem but change the left-hand boundary condition ($x=0$) to a convective boundary:
\begin{equation*}
	q(0) = h (T - T_{\infty}),
\end{equation*}
where $h$ is heat transfer coefficient with a value of 100 W/(\C m\spr{2}) and the ambient temperature $T_{\infty}$ = 10 \C .
