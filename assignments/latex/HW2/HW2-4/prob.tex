Using the \texttt{Line2.m} class as a guide and the incomplete \texttt{Line3.m} file provided, build a 1D, 3-node quadratic finite element and solve Problem 2 above using this element and compute the temperature gradient at the Gauss points. Compare the results between the two types of elements, include results using more than two elements.
